  A sphere is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball, 
  (viz., analogous to a circular object in two dimensions). Like a circle, which geometrically is a two-dimensional object, 
  a sphere is defined mathematically as the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point, 
  but in three-dimensional space.
